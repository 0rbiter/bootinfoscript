Usage boot_info_script:
-----------------------

  Run the script as sudoer:

    sudo bash ./boot_info_script.sh <outputfile>

  or if your operating system does not use sudo:

    su -
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh <outputfile>


  When running the script, without specifying an output file, all the output
  is written to the file "RESULTS.txt" in the same folder as the script.

  But when run from /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, or another system folder, the file
  "RESULTS.txt" is written to the home directory of the user.

  When the file "RESULTS.txt" already exists, the results will be written to
  "RESULTS1.txt". If "RESULTS1.txt" exists, the results will be written to
  "RESULTS2.txt", ...


  To get version number, release date, last git commit and git retrieval date
  of this script, use:
    (no root rights needed)

    bash ./boot_info_script.sh -v
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh -V
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh --version

  To get this help text, use (no root rights needed):

    bash ./boot_info_script.sh -h
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh -help
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh --help

  To automatically gzip a copy of the output file, use (root rights needed):

    bash ./boot_info_script.sh -g <outputfile>
    bash ./boot_info_script.sh --gzip <outputfile>

  The last development version of boot_info_script can be downloaded, with:
    (no root rights needed)

    bash ./boot_info_script.sh --update <filename>

  If no filename is specified, the file will be saved in the home dir as
  "boot_info_script_YYYY-MM-DD_hh:mm:ss.sh".

  If multiple versions of boot_info_script are detected in the same directory,
  boot_info_script will list all versions found.
  In that case you need to force boot_info_script to run a certain version,
  by adding "--this" as first argument (root rights needed):

    bash ./boot_info_script.sh --this <outputfile>



Features:
---------

* Look at each MBR and identify its boot loader:
    - For GRUB and SuperGRUB: display the controlling partition.
    - If the MBR is unknown, display the whole MBR.

* Look at all partitions:
    - Determine their type.
    - Identify their boot sectors.
        ° For GRUB: display the controlling partition and the offset of the
                    stage2 file as recorded in the boot sector.
        ° For Syslinux: display the full version name, check if internal
                        checksum matches, display installation directory,
                        display offset of the ldlinux.sys file.
        ° For NTFS and FAT: examine the Boot Parameter Block for errors.
    - Identify the operating system installed on that partition.
    - List boot programs.
    - Display the partition table.
    - Display the output of "blkid".
    - Look in "/" and "NST" for bootpart codes and display the offset and boot
      drive, it is trying to chainload.
    - Look on "/" and "/NST" for stage1 files and display the offset and boot
      drive of the stage 2 files it is trying to chainload.
    - Display boot configuration files.
    - Is able to search LVM partitions if the LVM2 package is installed
      ("apt-get install lvm2" in debian based distros).
    - Is able to search Linux Software RAID partitions (MD RAIDs) if the "mdadm"
      package is installed.
    - If dmraid is installed, search all RAID drives, detected by dmraid.
