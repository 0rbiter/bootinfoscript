Subject: [PATCH] do not print bogus partition number for GRUB 2.00

core.img partition number is computed only for GRUB < 2.00.
GRUB 2.00 never performs cross-disk installation and always
looks for core.img on the same disk where boot.img is located.

Slightly reorder messages and do not print bogus partition if
GRUB is 2.00 or above.
