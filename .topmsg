Subject: [PATCH] support core.img consisting of multiple fragments

core.img can be installed in multiple segments even when embedded
in post-MBR gap, and has high chances of being split if installed
directly from filesystem using block list mode. openSUSE is using
installation on partition by default and is quite likely to get
fragmented core.img.

Support parsing block list and collecting all fragements.
